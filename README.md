# Overview

Task Manager Core, is a task management application designed to efficiently organize and track tasks by their attributes such as title, description, priority, status, and deadlines. This application uses Kotlin's robust features to showcase real-world usage of its language constructs, including variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, and classes.

Task Manager Core was written to enhance my understanding of Kotlin syntax and its practical applications in developing scalable, maintainable applications. In this project I focused on the following Kotlin feathers
- Variables (mutable and immutable)
- Expressions
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Functions
- Classes
- Data classes
